## Introduction
IoT represents the intersection of hardware, software, and connectivity, enabling everyday objects to collect, analyze, and exchange data. My exploration in IoT encompasses a wide range of topics, including sensor integration, data visualization, cloud computing, and more.

## Projects

This repository contains a variety of IoT projects covering different aspects of IoT development, including:

- **Presentation ADC, PWM & Deep SleepSource Code**:
    - Presentation ADC: Code showcasing analog-to-digital conversion for sensor data acquisition in IoT applications.
    - PWM: Implementation of Pulse Width Modulation for precise control of actuators like motors and LEDs.
    - Deep Sleep: Source code demonstrating power-saving mode to prolong battery life in IoT devices during idle periods.
- **Smart Street light using IR and LDR Sensor**:
    - Implementation of an intelligent street lighting system that adjusts brightness based on ambient light levels detected by 
      LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) and presence of objects detected by IR (Infrared) sensors, promoting energy efficiency and safety.
- **PIR Interface with ESP8266 using Interrupts and Timers**:
    - Integration of Passive Infrared (PIR) motion sensors with ESP8266 microcontrollers, leveraging interrupts and timers for efficient and responsive detection of motion         events in IoT applications.
- **DHT11 Interface with ThingSpeak Cloud**:
    - Real-time data transmission from DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor to ThingSpeak cloud platform for remote monitoring and analysis in IoT applications.

Feel free to explore the projects, experiment with the code, and customize them to suit your requirements.
